% JSON strings into (json2mat) and from (mat2json) Matlab structures. The
% name, "...4MAT", is a wink to an old, outdated but similalry minded XML
% toolbox XML4MAT where loose typing was argued for as being closer to
% Matlab's own loose assignment of types within a mat structure
% (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.84.9787)
%
% This is the first version of JSON4MAT was developed specifically for
% COUCH4MAT (http://couch4mat.googlecode.com), a tbox developed to help
% with interoperability with CouchDB. A reflection of the idea of loose
% typing and dimensionality natural to Matlab environments is ported to the
% reading and writting of numerical matrices into JSON.
%
%% JSON2MAT
%
% JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has a much looser and smaller set of
% data types that Matlab. Also, unlike XML it does not explicitly make room
% for attributes to be defined to additionally characterize a data element
% such as size and class. As a consequence the JSON strings can be
% interpreted just as dynamically:
json='{lele:2,lili:4,lolo:[1,2,{lulu:5,bubu:[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]}]}';
mat=json2mat(json)
%% Dimensionality in numerical arrays
%
% The array of pairs of numbers suggests a 3x2 matrix and indeed JSON2MAT
% made that conversion:
mat.lolo{3}.bubu
%% Non-numerial arrays
% When there are non-numerical elements in a JSON array the array of arrays
% will be directly converted into a Matlab cell of cells. Notice the last
% numerical element of bubu is now "a".
json2mat('{lele:2,lili:4,lolo:[1,2,{lulu:5,bubu:[[1,2],[3,4],[5,"a"]]}]}');
ans.lolo{3}
%% Unmatched dimensionality
%
% The interpretation of arrays of arrays of numbers as corresponding to
% embedded dimensionality is performed by a try / catch command. Therefore,
% if teh dimensions don't match the cells of cells will be returned
% instead. In a future version maybe dimensionality in cell arrays will be
% coded in JSON2MAT as well, but presently that is only attempted for
% numerical arrays.
ans=json2mat('{lele:2,lili:4,lolo:[1,2,{lulu:5,bubu:[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6,7]]}]}');
ans.lolo{3}
%% MAT2JSON
%
% Since the original motivation for this toolbox was to read entries from a
% CouchDB deployment, the conversion of mat into json was designed with a
% single criterion in mind: that the reverse operation JSON2MAT would
% return the original mat structure. Accordingly, if we return to the mat
% structure generated from the json string produced under JSON2MAT above,
% one can confirm that the same string is returned from mat:
mat2json(mat)
