[This Matlab toolbox](http://json4mat.googlecode.com/files/json4mat_2010-05-18.zip) converts JSON formats into (json2mat) and from Matlab structures. The name, JSON4MAT, is a wink to an old, outdated but similalry minded XML toolbox XML4MAT (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.84.9787) from the days when XML was emerging as the interoperable format of choice and Matlab did have a native XML parser. JSON4MAT was originally developped to support another Matlab toolbox, [COUCH4MAT](http://couch4mat.googlecode.com).
